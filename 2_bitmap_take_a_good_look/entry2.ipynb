    "As WAV was one of the simplest ways to hold an audio file, bitmap is one of the simplest ways to hold an image file. Like WAV, there's no compression, lossy or otherwise.\n",

    "## Context: What is stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have sight, it's probably one of your keenest senses. Eyes tell us all about our environment. It was natural that computers would go beyond text to show images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our eyes and cameras see light as it hits a plane. We have no real idea where the photons are going, just what their wavelength are and where they hit. So each of our eyes and a single camera will see a plane of wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our audio files map out a single signal over one dimension, times the number of channels, images are a two dimensional signal best mapped on a grid. Further, there's the question of storing color in each cell of this grid. And in a sense, there's another level of depth in terms of the number of bits that go into describing the color in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color space is its own issue. While we can imagine most colors as a mixture of red, green, and blue light, and easily store color as three channels of color, we do not percieve all colors equally. Further, in low light, we percieve less color, and in near-darkness, we barely percieve color at all, because our retina's monochromatic rod cells function in low light unlike our color-sensitive cone cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a chart of where are eyes are most and least sensitive to color, assuming you aren't colorblind. [Courtesy of Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eyesensitivity.svg).\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://i.imgur.com/WF1fIJj.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, our eyes are most attuned to greens, and less to more violet and red shades. From an evolutionary perspective, it's speculated this is to do with the importance of distinguishing plants in a prehistoric environment. But this is a blogpost about image formats and not how we evolved to be the smartest apes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the past two paragraphs aren't extremely relevant here. But imagine how this knowledge could make a more compact/effective image format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, what the BMP bitmap format does is store a list of RGB values, and assigns that index to each color. This means a single integer stands in for what would be a three integer structure. It reminds me a bit of the [palette systems older video game consoles used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes).\n",

    "## The Metadata\n",

    "For this example, I would like to use a bitmap conversion of our tapir friends from Entry 0. The version you're seeing below is a JPG, because bitmaps actually take up a good amount of space. It'd be a waste of bandwidth. How is it so much smaller? That's another post.\n",
