    "\n",
    "We should have an OS level understanding of what a file is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm basing this notebook off of how Linux manages files, because I personally run Linux and have half-an-idea where to find docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files are more or less strings of bytes, with a bunch of abstractions that eventually translate into information stored in some kind of memory. This means users don't need to worry about where the file actually goes on the disk, physically, so long as there's space. Somewhere, the kernel or a file system module maps the file's path to some physical address, and manages allocating space and linking bits of space that aren't connected. Like a lot of low level computing, this is a world of pointers and linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there's also metadata. Files have names, as well as timestamps for when the file was created, modified, and/or last accessed. And on a multiuser system (really any system these days, even if it's your personal device), there are permissions to specify who can read, write, or execute with that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "And part of that metadata is information on what's inside the file. On Windows, that's traditionally been done with the three or longer character extension after the `.` (although I imagine there's probably a bit more sophistication these days), while Unix-y systems do something robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a file, and now I have some questions. I downloaded it from Wikimedia, [so I'm welcome to share it](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tapir_con_cr%C3%ADa.JPG).\n",
